Runnable commands in current build 

  Commands you can run:

  # `Single poll (test it first)`
  `npm run track:once`

  `Continuous tracking (polls every 5 minutes)`
  `npm run track`

  # `View collected stats and time-of-day analysis`
  `npm run stats`

  Go ahead and reopen your terminal with the correct nvm, then test with:

  npm run track:once

  This will take an initial snapshot. Run it again after playing some games and it will detect the changes and record the timestamp.
